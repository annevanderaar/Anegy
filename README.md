# Anne's Movie Application

_This app was made using the tutorial from Asish George Tech. You can find that using this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Bvt6BFf6_U. I used this tutorial as a base but i have made it my own by implementing more functions and rewrite it using React_

With Anne's Movie Application you can discover all the movies and series. You can make an account and add your favorite movies to you watch list. You can also keep up with you favorite movies and series and cross of the episodes/movies that you have watched. You can search and filter using genre, year and title. You can also select if you want to see the most populair movies or series.

_It makes use of the TMDB API. You can find everything about this API here: https://developers.themoviedb.org/._

The App is made in React with a MODX backend.

## Features

### These are the features that i used from the tutorial:

- A search bar that searches on title.
- A filter that you can use to pick a specific genre.
- Show movies (with score and with hover that has a short overview)
- An overlay that shows the trailers for the movies
- An previous and next page function with scroll to the top

### These are my own added features:

- An account feature
- A favorite feature
- A watchlist feature
- More information on the overlay than just trailers. Such as year, cast and wich platforms you can see it on.
